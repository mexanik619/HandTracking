🖐️ Hand Tracking & 🧠 Image Recognition Script
This Python script allows you to run real-time hand tracking using your webcam or perform image classification using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. It combines computer vision techniques with deep learning to demonstrate two useful applications.

📦 Requirements
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

bash

hand_tracking.py         # Main script file
myimage.png              # Image to be used for classification (optional)
🚀 How to Use
Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python hand_tracking.py
You will be prompted to choose a mode:

java
Copy
Edit
Choose a mode:
1 - Hand Tracking (Webcam)
2 - Image Recognition (Static Image)
Mode 1: Hand Tracking
Activates your webcam.

Uses MediaPipe to detect and track hands in real-time.

Displays hand landmarks drawn on the live video feed.

Press q to quit.

Mode 2: Image Recognition
Loads a static image file (myimage.png).

Uses the MobileNetV2 model pretrained on ImageNet.

Prints the top 3 predictions with confidence scores.

Replace 'myimage.png' in the script with your own image if needed.

📌 Functions Explained
handtrack()
Initializes the webcam and MediaPipe Hands module.

Converts each frame to RGB and processes it to find hand landmarks.

Draws the landmarks on the video stream.

Displays the live stream with annotations.

imgrecognition()
Loads the MobileNetV2 model with ImageNet weights.

Loads and preprocesses the image for classification.

Prints the top 3 predictions.

⚠️ Notes
Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible.

Place your image file (myimage.png) in the same directory or provide the correct path.

You can enhance the script with argparse for better control from the command line.
